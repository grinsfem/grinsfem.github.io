{"name":"GRINS Multiphysics Finite Element Package","tagline":"GRINS: A C++ Multiphysics Finite Element Package based on the libMesh Finite Element Library","body":"## GRINS\r\n\r\n`GRINS` is a C++ finite element framework that aims to quickly enable the simulation of complex mathematical models by reusing developed modeling capabilities while also simplifying the introduction of new capabilities. It is built on top of the [libMesh finite element library](http://libmesh.github.io).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n`GRINS` requires a `libMesh` installation. Additionally, [Boost](http://www.boost.org) is also required (although we plan to remove this requirement in the near future). We also highly recommend your `libMesh` installation be built with [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/).\r\n\r\nRelease tarballs are available [here](https://github.com/grinsfem/grins/releases). We use `autotools` so follow the `configure; make; make install` paradigm. If cloning from the main repository, you will need to run the `bootstrap.sh` script first (this step requires an `autotools` installation) then proceed with `configure; make; make install`. Out-of-source (`VPATH`) and parallel builds are supported. Additionally, you can check the `GRINS` installation by running `make check` (again, may be run in parallel).\r\n\r\nHelp is available using `configure --help`. By default, `GRINS` is built with optimization enabled and debugging turned off. Use `METHOD=dbg` or `METHOD=devel` at configure time to enable debugging flags.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nOnline Doxygen pages are available [here](http://grinsfem.github.io/grins/html/)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n`GRINS` is released under the LGPL 2.1 license. See the `LICENSE` file for details.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nWe welcome feedback/bug reports through GitHub Issues on the `GRINS` page. We also welcome contributed enhancements and bug fixes through pull requests.\r\n\r\n## User Support\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or need help with using or contributing to `GRINS`, feel free to ask questions on one of the mailing lists:\r\n\r\n* [grins-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/grins-users) mailing list for questions regarding usage and reporting bugs\r\n* [grins-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/grins-devel) mailing list for discussion regarding development of `GRINS`\r\n\r\n## Citing GRINS\r\n\r\nIf you use `GRINS` in your work, we ask that you please cite `GRINS` and `libMesh`:\r\n\r\n    @article{libMeshPaper,\r\n             author = {B.~S.~Kirk and J.~W.~Peterson and R.~H.~Stogner and G.~F.~Carey},\r\n             title = {{\\texttt{libMesh}: A C++ Library for Parallel Adaptive Mesh\r\n                      Refinement/Coarsening Simulations}},\r\n             journal = {Engineering with Computers},\r\n             volume = {22},\r\n             number = {3--4},\r\n             pages = {237--254},\r\n             year = {2006},\r\n             note = {\\url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00366-006-0049-3}}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @article{GRINSPaper,\r\n             author = {P.~T.~Bauman and R.~H.~Stogner},\r\n             title = {GRINS: A Multiphysics Framework Based on the libMesh Finite Element Library},\r\n             note = {submitted,\\url{http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06102}}\r\n    }","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
